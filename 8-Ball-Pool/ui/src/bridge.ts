 * `{ type: "barrelo:gameState", snapshot, playerNames }` on every state change. The snapshot carries the
 * visit log; the rules are re-derived from it here, in `replay()`.
 *
 * Up: this game owns its own rules, so Barrelo doesn't know whose turn it is or when the match is over.
 * Both are reported back — display hints on every state change, and the final result exactly once.
 *
 * Scenes subscribe to GAME_STATE_EVENT rather than reading window.postMessage directly, so they never
 * need to know how any of this arrives.
